        <p>If you’re seeing this, that means you haven’t forgotten—or maybe you did and just stumbled across this randomly. Either way, I’ll take it.

Last time we spoke (as of me typing this), you told me you were trying to focus on your path, and I hope that’s been going well for you. I won’t lie, I admire that about you.

Honestly, I’m writing this just to check on you—because I miss you and, well, I kinda like making sure you're okay. And if possible, maybe we could talk sometime? I wouldn’t mind hearing your voice again.
        Anyway, this is just a reminder that I miss you, I hope you’re okay, and I wish you the best wherever you are. I pray for you to succeed because, honestly, you were the best out of all of us. And, well... you’ve always been kinda hard to forget.
        anyways i made the interlude maybe drake can rap over it
