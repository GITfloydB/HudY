        <h1>Letter to Hudy</h1>
        <p>Man, oh man! Don’t think anyone has ever made me do something like this, but I guess there’s a first for everything.

            Just want to start it off by introducing myself. My name is Floyd (Hi), and this is a letter to Hudy.
            
            I’m writing this because I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like her… although the first time I saw her, I was somewhat put off because of the carnivorous glares she gave as people walked by. But I quickly summoned the courage to speak to her, and it’s probably one of the best decisions I’ve made to date.
            
            Hudy is someone that I have personally cherished close to my heart because I feel as if she is someone I can be myself with. She brings out a side of me that I don’t normally share, and it’s because of how incredibly loving, caring, and understanding she is. I remember the first proper conversation we had, and she explained to me that she was a Hall Of Fame F1 Ferrari Glazer.
            
            That alone proved to me she was one of a kind, because, on bro, I’ve never seen anyone be such a die-hard for Ferrari like that, even as they lost! Which is crazy to me 'cause it’s freaking Ferrari, ain’t y'all supposed to be stallions???
            
            Nevertheless, it made me more intrigued as to how her beautiful mind works.
            
            I also remember a day when we played her family card game, and this is the first-ever card game I’ve played where it is only possible for her to win. Like how am I supposed to know your cards then stack them and xyz? That game was rigged from the beginning; I was never going to win.
            
            But yet again, it made me more intrigued as to how her beautiful mind works.
            
            I also remember the day we were in the th on our iPads playing Roblox, and I hate to say it, but I got scared by the horror game. I don’t like jump scares, and how can she suggest we play a game with jump scares? It's all good though 'cause big Hudy was there to save the day.
            
            Once again, it made me more intrigued as to how her beautiful mind works.
            
            I could keep writing about all the memories I have in the time I’ve known her, which hasn’t been so long, but to me, it has felt like I’ve known her for decades. And the memories I have, I will always cherish, and I will always be grateful that I have her in my life. And I am looking forward to making more (if she permits, 'cause she always goes MIA like every two weeks, so I just hope I don’t die by the time she’s back from her next one).
            
            But, Hudy, I want to thank you for tolerating me, and I want to say, in I think I like you way more than I thought. I don’t know; it’s just something about you that I never want to forget, and I always want to speak with you, and I don’t know, you just make me feel some way.
            
            Maybe it’s the machboos I ate that day, but genuinely, I really care about you, and as much as it pains me that you're leaving, I wish you all the best wherever you go.
        
        <p>On a final note i dont know if you remember but i want to share with you a special interlude down below</p>
